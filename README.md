# Logistic Regression
Here's something that many people confuse about Logistic Regression. Why other categoriszation methods like Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting come under Machine Learning but Logistic comes under Regression? It is because Machine Learning Models make prediction after they have been trained by the data that has been fed to them. These models can now only predict from values that are present within that range of values that has been fed to them. Regression on the other hand can also predict outcomes for values that have been fed outside its training data range. Logistic Regression model finds the best fit for the data and then make predictions based on the best fit sigmoid function.

For this project, I will be working on an Airline's data to check customer satisfaction. We will take the following steps to execute this whole project:
* Exploring the data and completing the cleaning process
* Pre-processing the data before building a logistic regression model
* Building a binomial logistic regression model
* Evaluating a binomial logistic regression model using a confusion matrix
